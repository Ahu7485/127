* TA Schedule
Below is the Teaching Assistant office schedule. 

Some sessions will be drop in for general help and sometimes there
will be specific topics and materials that the teaching assistants
will go over. If the TA is running an open session on a topic, they
will announce it in the TA stream for the course on Zulip with a link
to join (Zoom, Google Meet etc.). If you're dropping in and there
isn't a session already running, place a message on the TA Zulip
stream for the course and the TA. Support won't always be via live
meeting, it might also happen through the Zulip chat.
